       "<p>The temporal fixed-charge multicommodity flow problem (tfMCF) is a problem that aims to optimize intra-day decisions in a transportation network to increase delivery speed, which means maximizing the number of packages delivered on time. It is formulated as a Resource Task Network (RTN), a framework commonly used for chemical process industry applications. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer program, which can become prohibitively large as the number of origin-destination pairs increases. Therefore, a model condensation technique is proposed to group similar OD pairs into buckets, reducing the number of variables and constraints by a factor of 25%-50%. The proposed model is extremely large, even for moderately-sized input graphs, and several techniques are developed to reduce its size and solve it efficiently.</p>"
