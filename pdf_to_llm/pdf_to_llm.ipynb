It is formulated as a Resource Task Network (RTN) and is presented as a mixed-integer-programming (MIP) model. The problem can become prohibitively large as the number of origin, destination (OD) pairs increases, so a model condensation technique is proposed to group similar OD pairs into buckets and reduce the number of variables and constraints. The proposed model is extremely large, so several techniques are developed to reduce its size, including exploiting synergies between flows of certain commodities, utilizing the geometric nature of the instances in the application studied, and developing a linear programming filtering heuristic.</p>"
